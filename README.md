# ZIP Tileset Importer
An import plugin for the Godot game engine (version 4.4). It can:
- Create standard 47-tile "blob" tilesets from a ZIP file that contains separate tile images, so you won't have to do this manually.
- Generate missing tiles by flipping, rotating or merging other tiles.
- Augment the tileset with an 88-tile slope tileset, which contains various connection tiles.

The following image types are supported: BMP, PNG, JPG, TGA, WEBP, SVG, DDS, KTX. The images in the ZIP files must conform to specific filenames (see the image below).

## Install Guide
1. Create a folder called `Addons/ZipTilesetImporter`.
2. Extract the contents of this repository to that folder.
3. Enable the import plugin under `Project Settings` => `Plugins`.

## How to Use
After installing, create a ZIP file and fill it with image files, using the filenames in the image below.

### Standard Tiles
This image shows you which tile each filename maps to:

For example, the file `archive.zip/NOOK_TR.png` would be used as the top-right outer corner tile.

As stated before, missing tiles will be automatically generated. See `Documentation/TileGeneration.md` for more details about the generation process.

### Slope Tiles
Normally, slopes will not be generated by the importer. However, if you include one of the following in your ZIP file, a slope block will be allocated below the standard tiles.

These are the relevant filenames:

### User-Defined Tiles
You can add custom tiles by adding images with filenames that are not in the image above. These tiles are placed below the standard tileset area. For example, if you want to add slopes to your tileset you can do so in this way.

## Tile Generation
Tiles can be loaded from a ZIP archive in three ways:
1. Load it directly from an image file.
2. Construct it from part images.
3. Derive it from other tiles in the tileset.

### Parts
If you prefix your tile image with `PART_`, the importer will treat it as a tile part image. Tile parts are overlayed on top of the `CENTER` image using straightforward alpha-compositing to create the target tile image.

Here, the `EDGE_T` tile is created by overlaying the `PART_EDGE_T` image over the `PART_CENTER` image. The `MASK_EDGE_T` controls how blending is done: white pixels replace the background pixels, while black pixels are blended with it.

You can mix prefab tiles and tile parts as you see fit; if a tile has both a prefab image and part images, the prefab is always used.

Like prefab tiles, part images can be derived from other part images.

## Planned Features
- 1-by-2 slopes.
- 2-by-1 slopes.
- Adding the option for tile variants.
